# GE2_Assignment
My project is based on a scene from the BBC documentary Planet Earth 2, shown below in the proposal section.

Name: Alex Cronin

Student Number: C12499592

# Description of the assignment

The birds flying in the scene are using the FollowPath behaviour, but for some reason I couldn't get them to follow the path.
The iguana follows a path while being chased by three snakes.
The snakes use the Pursue and Offset Pursue behaviours
When the snake catches the iguana, it dies.
There are other snakes in the scene which roam the terrain using the wander behaviour. When they are within a certain range of the iguana then they activate the Pursue behaviour and the chase begins. The iguana being chased activates the Flee behaviour if a snake gets too close.
